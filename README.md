# STAT4052 Final Project

This Github will serve as our R appendix for the STAT 4052 Project

First, run the Original Setup.R and that will set up all 3 models for the mean imputation part of the project.
Then, Regression Imputation.R can be run and that will set up the 3 models for the regression imputation part of the project.

## Flow of Code
1) Original Setup.R
2) Logistic Regression/LDA/Random Forest - Mean.rmds
3) Regression Imputation.R
4) Logistic Regression/LDA/Random Forest - Regression.rmds
